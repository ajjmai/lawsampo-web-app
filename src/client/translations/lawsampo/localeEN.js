      You first have to select the initial search parameters from the lefthand side.
      You can use either free text search or select one of the predefined main categories.
      First search results are shown after the selection and user interface swithes to
      mode designed to help you to focus the search by selecting additional categories or
      keywords.
      </p>
      <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph">
      If you started with a text search, you can add a category information after initial
      information. On the other hand, if you already have selected a category, you can use
      the suggested keywords to specify the search. Results are updated after every change.

      Positive keywords are selected using "+" icon and negative ones with a "-" icon. Documents
      containing positive keywords are included in the results whereas content associated with
      negative keywords are excluded from the results. Number after each keyword represents the
      weight of the keyword in the current result set.

      <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph">
      Since suggested keywords only show 25 of the "best" keywords at a time, is is possible

      The Case Law view consists of two parts: the result set and facets. The facets are on the left hand side of the page and they can be used to
      scale the results set to find what the user is looking for. The results set is divided into three different tabs: Table, By Year, and Export. These tabs
      show the results in different formats. The table view shows the results as a list whereas the By Year tab shows a yearly distribution of the
      court decisions.

      In the <b>Table tab</b> the results are shown as a list that can be scaled down using the facets. The facets contain options to target different court decisions.
      The facets can be opened using the small arrow in the right hand side of the facet. This opens the facet and shows it's options (e.g., "Subject keyword")
      or text search field (e.g., "Free text search"). There is also a text search field to scale down the number of options in the facets with multiple choices.
      Some facets also contain a hierarchy for options (e.g., "Decision date") to help the user. These hierarchies can be browsed by clicking the arrow on the
      left hand side of the option.
      </p>
      <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph">
      Some of the options contain also a pie chart option to view the distribution of the values of the options in the data. In order to view the value distribution
      of the data, the user can click the pie chart icon located next to the arrow that can be used to open the facet. The pie chart icon is only available when the
      facet has been opened. By clicking the pie chart icon, the user is shown a pie chart on a white background. The user can see the legend on the top right corner
      of the view and the pie chart in the center. By hovering over the pie chart the user will get the legend for each piece of the pie. By clicking outside the
      view, the user can close the view.
      </p>
      <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph">
      In the <b>By Year tab</b>, the user can look at the distribution of court decisions by year. By taking the mouse cursor on top of the line, the user will get the number of
      court decisions at the time. In this view the user can also use the facets to scale down the number of court decisions by year similarly to Table tab.
      </p>
      <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph">
      In the <b>Export tab</b> the user can export the data into an external Yasgui application by clicking the button for that. Also here the resultset can be scaled down using the
      facets on the left hand side of the view.

      About the Portal
    </h1>
    <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph">
      LawSampo system consists of two components. 1) The LawSampo portal with its different application perspectives
      is targeted for human end-users for searching and exploring Finnish legislation and case law.
      2) The portal is based on the Linked Open  Data service Semantic Finlex that publishes data of the national
      Finlex service of the Ministry of Justice in Finland. The data service can be used freely for
      application development and is available at the Finnish Linked Data service LDF.fi.
    </p>
    <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph">
      LawSampo is a living laboratory prototype on the Web. It has been developed by the Semantic Computing Research
      Group (SeCo) at various research projects with the Ministry of Justice and Edita Publishing Ltd in Aalto University
      and Helsinki Centre for Digital Humanities (HELDIG) at the University of Helsinki in collaboration.

      General Idea
    </h2>
    <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph">
      The LawSampo Portal enables you to search and explore the legislative data originating from Semantic Finlex.
      In addition, the portal is equipped with ready-to-use tools for Digital Humanities research using the
      <a href="https://seco.cs.aalto.fi/publications/2020/hyvonen-sampos-dhn-2020.pdf" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>
      "Sampo" model</a> where the portal is used as follows:
    </p>
    <ol class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-gutterBottom">
    <li class="MuiTypography-gutterBottom">
        On the front page of the portal different perspectives to the data are given as a selection: the statutes of
        consolidated legislation, the sections of consolidated legislation, case law, case law finder (external service), and
        contextual legislation search.
        The idea is to provide access to the underlying data (knowledge graph)
        through multiple use cases while the data remains the same.
      </li>
      <li class="MuiTypography-gutterBottom">
        In the perspectives of statutes, sections, and caselaw, the faceted search can be used for filtering out a subset
        of objects of the view, the “target group” of interest. For example, statutes of a given time period can be selected.
        By default the perspectives display all results from the corresponding class (Statute, Section, Case Law).
        This default result set can be narrowed down by using the filters.
      </li>
      <li class="MuiTypography-gutterBottom">
        Finally, visualization tools can be applied to study the target group. For example, it is possible
        to see on the temporal distribution of the court decisions of the case law.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph">
      Using the "Export" tab in a perspective and then the button "Open SPARQL query in YASGUI" the SPARQL query corresponding to
      the facet selections made is shown in the
      <a href="https://yasgui.triply.cc" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>
      YASGUI</a> SPARQL querying interface with the results. Additional YASGUI tools for studying the results and downloading
      the data are available there. For example, the results of the query can be downloaded in CSV format for additional
      spreadsheet computing.

      Using a Single Filter in Faceted Search
    </h2>
    <h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 MuiTypography-gutterBottom">
      Selecting values within a filter
    </h3>
    <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph">
      All possible values for a filter are displayed either as a list or as a hierarchical
      tree (if available). The number of results is shown in brackets for each value.
      Once a value is selected, the results are automatically updated. To prevent further
      selections that do not return any results, also the possible values for all other
      filters are updated at the same time.
    </p>
    <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph">
      Multiple values can be selected within a single filter. Selecting multiple values
      generates results that contain <strong>any</strong> of the selected values. For example, selecting
      two different directives in the EU directive facet returns results that
      make references to either of them.
    </p>
    <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph">
      Selected values of a filter appear in the Active filters section at the top of the list
      of filters. To deselect a filter, click the X mark next to it within the Active filters
      section. You can also deselect a filter value by unchecking the checkmark in the
      filter’s value list. The Active filters section only appears if there are filter
      values currently selected.
    </p>
    <h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 MuiTypography-gutterBottom">
      Searching categories within a filter
    </h3>
    <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph">
      Category selections within a filter can be searched by using the search field at the
      top of each filter. All possible values of a filter remain visible at all times.
      The values of the filter that match the search term are indicated by a purple underline.
    </p>
    <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph">
      Steps for searching within filters:
    </p>
    <ol class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-gutterBottom">
      <li class="MuiTypography-gutterBottom">
        Type search term into search field. If there are matches, a number
        will appear to the right of the search field, indicating the number
        of filter values that match the search term.
      </li>
      <li class="MuiTypography-gutterBottom">
        Click the arrows " <  > " to the right of the search field to cycle through
        the results. As you click the arrow, a different filter value will appear
        at the top of the list. Matched filters are underlined in purple.
      </li>
      <li class="MuiTypography-gutterBottom">
        Click the checkmark next to a filter value to activate it.
        The results (and also other filters) are automatically updated.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
    <h2 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h4 MuiTypography-gutterBottom">
      Using Multiple Filters Simultaneously
    </h2>
    <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph">
      The effectiveness of faceted search is realized when multiple filters are
      applied at the same time. As in many e-commerce sites, a logical AND is
      always used between the filters.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph">
      In faceted search you can make selections in filters in any order, and the hit
      counts in the other filters are automatically updated. In this way you never end
      up in "no hits" dead ends.
